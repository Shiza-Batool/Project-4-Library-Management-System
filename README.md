# Library Management System

# Abstract:
To operate normally, every system would require management. In this current era of technology, a Library accomplishes the same thing for its smooth work flow. This program was designed to keep the data safe and accessible. Consider how many books from the library could be lost as a result of a data breach, as well as the data of the user, whether he is a library member or not. With only one click, the Admin can quickly track the user's record as well as the books that have been issued or are available in the library.
As a result, by using what we learned in class about Python OOP and Data Structure to develop a program that solves such issues in a library.

# Introduction:
The project is intended to maintain track of two key bodies: a library's administrator and a library's user. This project keeps track of all of the books in the library, whether they are issued or returned, as well as all of the library's members. If a new book is added to the library, the administrator can insert it, or delete it if it is no longer available. The user can ask the admin to issue them a book, check if the book has been issued to them, and return the book they have received from the admin. Each user will be assigned a unique user ID.

# Objectives:
- 1. The main object of the library management system is to manage details of members, issues, books, student.
- 2. Library Management system helps in maintaining data of books issued to learners.
- 3. Library Management system helps in maintaining data of books available in the library.
- 4. This helps librarians spot any particular book at any given time in the library.
- 5. It helps in keeping track of the books, catalogues, magazines, etc.
- 6. This system increases the efficiency of the librarian and better management of the library.
- 7. This system completely automates all your libraryâ€™s activities.
- 8. Easy search of the desired book from the library.

# Implementation:
- The program can be implemented by creating an algorithm that allows the user to add, remove, view, assign, and return a book to a library member using the Doubly link list, with some features like Stack, Queue, and File Handling.
- Furthermore, we will develop a login mechanism to determine whether or not a user is a library member, which will be done using the file handling system.

# Methodology/ Plan development to solve the Problem:
Because we need to insert, delete, and search the Book, we're implementing the Double Link List, which is more efficient than alternative data structures. Because we have a constant time complexity of big O(1) for such functions in linked lists, it is easier to perform tasks like insertion and deletion. To create our project, we'll utilise the following function.

   # Login
   At login menu we will be asked to choose if we are an Admin or we are a user. If we choose admin the we will be taken to admin login check to verify if we are admin or not and it will be checked by entering the user name and the password and the same is true for user. If we are a use then we will be asked to enter our login info so we can perform the user specific functions.

   # Admin Login Check
   If we choose that we are admin the we will be asked to Enter the user name and the password if it the entered user name and password is true then we will be asked to choose a function we want to perform e.g Add Book.
   # If Admin 
   - 
      - Add Book
      Using the function Insertnewbook we add node as a book in the DLL and at the same
      time that node is added in a file name Book.py to keep record of the books.
      - Del Book
      Using the function Deletebook we delete the node in the DLL and also from the file
      named Book.py
      - Issue Book
      In Issue Book Function First we will check the request of the user who want to issue the book the first person that requested will be issued the book      first and after that every other in a queue will be severed. After taking the request we will issued the book to the user and del the book from the        files and add it in a dictionary to keep record of book issued.
      - View Books
      In View Book Function we will traverse the whole DLL and check each node (node are books) if the book user looking for is a node of DLL then we will r      eturn that the book is available in the Library.
      - View Record of Issued Books
      View Record of the Issued function will give us a list of the book that has been issued to the users and currently not available in the library.

   # User Login Check
   This Function will check the user if the user is the member of the library by check it user id , user name and password if it is true then the user can have access to the library and we will able to perform the specific functions e.g Request for issue Book.
   # If User
   -
      - Request For Issue Book
      In this function the user will be able to request for a book and will wait for his/her turn. If the user is the first in the queue then he/she we will  issued the book first.
      - Return Book
      The return book function is used for returning the book by the user. The user can easily return the book to the library.
      - Reissue:
      The Book user recently return if he/she wants to reissue it the user can easily use this function.
      - View Book
      In View Book Function we will traverse the whole DLL and check each node (node are books) if the book user looking for is a node of DLL then we will return that the book is available in the Library.
      - View if Book is Issued or not
      This function is used by the user to check is the admin issued him/her the book or not.

   # Register Your-Self
   If the User is not register they cannot login in to issue a book so before login we have a function for those user who are not register but want to be a member of the library then they can register their self easily.
